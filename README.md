# AUTOMATIC-DETECTION-OF-TUBERCULOSIS-USING-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
- We built an AI system that detects tuberculosis (TB) in chest X-rays at a level
comparable to radiologists
- a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for medical images, specifically for
classifying Lung cancers
- Also built the web-interface using Streamlit
